The notes below cover the first 2 videos in the playlist.


MODES
-------------------

Go to Regular mode = esc(remaped tp CAPS Lock) 

ESC (remaped to CAOS LOCK) to go into Normal mode.
i = insert
v = visual
r = replace

----------

Editing & Moving around:

Moving up down left and right
j = down
k = up
h = left
l = = righ

scroll half way up or down
CTRL + u for up
CTRL + d for down

b = back one word at a time
w = forward one word at a time
e = jump forward faster

SHIFT + G (cap G) jump to bottom of the page
gg = jump to top of page

gj at first line

{d} = delete a word and tapping d multiple times (dslakfj) whole words and

u = to undo what ever u just did

or 

DELETION

To delete chars inside () go on a char inside the ( ) then press ct closing
parenthese:  ct )

that deletes everything inside the parenthese, and puts you in insert mode.

SHIFT + f deletes the rest of the line and puts you in insert mode.

d = delete a word and tapping d multiple times  detetes whole words and

SHIFT + v to higlight the whole first line, then move down or jump to the end
or the paragraph

to delete everything between { } ijn a block of code, just go to the top line
at the first { then hit 

    di{ then p to paste it some where else if you want.

example 


func main() {
        line1
        line2
        line3
    }



Copy a line and paste it one line below without using visual mode:
be in Normalmode, and have the cursor on any char in the line/sentence,
then press

yy + p 

SHIFT + } = jumps down between paragraphs and or blocks of code.
and
SHIFT + { = jumps up between paragraphs

jump to a matching character:
put the cursor on the specific char,  and press %


Relative line jumping:
hit the numer of lines to move up, then press j to jump down that number of lines or k to jump up that number of lines.

d + 3 + j = puts in delete mode, instructs 3 to move, j says move down

and to do this up, hit k instead of j

to gradualy highlight words, hit go into vis mode, then tap w to highlight words to the right, and b to go back

$ = jumps to end of line but before last char in in normal mode
A = jumps to very end of line into insert mode
0 = Jumps to begining of the line
_ = jumps to beging of line

SHIFT + I jump to begining of line in insert mode.
SHIFT + A jump to end of line in insert mode.
