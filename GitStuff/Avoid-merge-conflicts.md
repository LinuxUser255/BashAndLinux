# Git Best Practices to Avoid Merge Conflicts

## 1. Pull Changes Frequently
Regularly update your local branch with the latest changes from the main branch (e.g., `git pull origin main`).
This reduces the likelihood of conflicts when merging by keeping your branch synchronized with the shared codebase and avoiding large, divergent changes.

---

## 2. Work in Small, Focused Commits
Break large changes into smaller, manageable commits.
Smaller commits are easier to review, understand, and debug, and they reduce the risk of merge conflicts.

---

## 3. Communicate with Your Team
Discuss significant changes with your team.
Clear communication helps avoid overlapping work and ensures everyone is aware of what others are working on.

---

## 4. Rebase Instead of Merging (When Appropriate)
Use `git rebase` to apply your changes on top of the latest main branch.
Rebasing keeps your commit history cleaner and can prevent unnecessary merge commits.
> ⚠️ Use with caution—rebasing can sometimes create complex conflicts, especially in shared branches.

---

## 5. Standardize Formatting
Use formatters and linters to enforce consistent code style across the project.
This minimizes conflicts caused by formatting (e.g., whitespace, indentation).

---

## 6. Use Feature Flags
For larger teams or complex features, use feature flags to isolate work in progress.
This allows merging incomplete features without disrupting the main codebase, reducing conflict risks.

---

## 7. Use Git Tools for Conflict Resolution
Leverage tools like:
- GitHub’s built-in conflict editor
- `git mergetool`
- GUI-based diff tools (e.g., Meld, VSCode, Beyond Compare)

These tools simplify identifying and resolving conflicts during merges.

### ✅ Summary
Following these practices consistently helps reduce the frequency and complexity of merge conflicts, streamlining collaboration and keeping your project history clean.
