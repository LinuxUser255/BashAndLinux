This one's cool. It makes vim look like Atom ,(The IDE). But is tricky to install just right. Their directions are not that great.
# onedark.vim
https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim

# This is how I installed it:
From my base, regular user home directory:

git clone https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim.git  ~/.vim/pack/dark/opt/onedark
