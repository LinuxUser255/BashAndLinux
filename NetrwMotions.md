" Open Netrw to the directory of the current file
autocmd VimEnter * if argc() == 0 | :Explore | endif

" Hide banner
let g:netrw_banner = 0

" Open splits below and to the right
let g:netrw_browse_split = 4

" Enable tree-style listing
let g:netrw_liststyle = 3

" Set window size for Netrw
let g:netrw_winsize = 25
