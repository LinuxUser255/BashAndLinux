# This script will print new aliases and commands to the screen
# I wrote this script because I make so many aliases and shortcuts
# that I don't always remeber them all
# Edit this script according to whatever aliases and shortcut commands you create
# All text is printed in red as dictaed by: "\e[1;31m   \e[0m"
# You can use that ^^^ as a template for printing text in red,
#  Just place the text to print between these two "\e[1;31m   \e[0m"
#  must be used with printf, Not echo
#  example:
#  printf "\e[1;31m text to print to the screen  \e[0m" 
#  headers : List of HTTP request headers.
#  xfh : List of X-Forwarded for headers.
#  stealcookies : XSS exploit code to steal cookies.
#  space : Double spaces lines of a text file.
#  remap : Remaps caps lock to the escape key.
#  gprac : cd's to a practice dir for go lang.
#  showgoimports : prints package main & imports for a .go file.
#  clte : Content-Length Transfer-Encoding Req Smuggling template.
