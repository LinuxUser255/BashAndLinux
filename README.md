#### Advanced_Bash-Scripting_Guide
##### An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting

https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/

This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming,
yet progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction . . . 
all the while sneaking in little nuggets of UNIXÂ® wisdom and lore. 
It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques.
The exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to programming concepts.This document is herewith granted to the Public Domain.
